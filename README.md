Random coding projects that I do sometimes. You can view and improve the code. This is a place where people can learn to improve their code too.

## Code of Conduct

Read CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md before contributing.

## Contributing

You can improve the code by forking the project then clone the repo and update the submodules, then adding code with the improvements with comments. Next add yourself to Contributors.md. Last send a pull request. See Contributing.md for more info.
